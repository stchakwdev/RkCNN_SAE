# Phase 1: Toy Model Configuration
# This configuration tests RkCNN on a toy model of superposition

# Toy model parameters
n_features: 10          # Number of ground truth features
d_hidden: 5             # Hidden dimension (creates superposition when < n_features)
feature_probability: 0.1  # Sparsity: probability a feature is active

# Data generation
n_samples: 5000         # Number of samples to generate

# RkCNN probing parameters
m: 2                    # Subset size (dimensions per subset)
h: 100                  # Total number of random subsets to sample
r: 10                   # Number of top subsets to keep
score_method: "knn"     # Scoring method: "knn", "kurtosis", "variance_ratio"
k_neighbors: 5          # Number of neighbors for KNN scoring

# Execution
seed: 42
device: "cpu"           # CPU is sufficient for Phase 1
verbose: true

# Output
output_dir: "./results/phase1"
